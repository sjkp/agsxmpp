agsxmpp - facebook chat fixes 

This repository contains a few fixes to the original code from svn://svn.ag-software.de/agsxmpp in order to make facebook chat integration work as described here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/chat/. 

It looks like the code was never tested, so there was some obvious errors in the challenge code to the Sasl response. 

I'm using this code in a project of my own, so if I find other problems I will try to fix them. At some point later I will post some complete sample code.
